# Node-Hangman

Welcome to the Node Js hangman game.  The point of this game was to improve my javascript skills and implement my earlier version of a hangman game but deploy it completely in the terminal.

The only dependency used for this project was inquirer.

First, the main.js file is the main component of this program.  It requires all the other files to run the game.  The game.js file 
is where my current word bank is hidden.  The letter.js file is where the word blanks are filled in for both the correct guessed and wrongly guessed letters for the chosen word.  Finally, word.js is where we compare the users input word against the correct word and tell them if they are correct or not.

Below are two screen shots showing the working node js program in action.
